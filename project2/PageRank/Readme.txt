Implement the PageRank algorithm and run for 100 iterations.
1. Compile the source code: g++ -g -Wall -fopenmp -o PageRank PageRank.cpp
2. Run run.sh. There are 3 parameters: 1) mode; 2) the number of threads; 3) the number of nodes.
If the mode is 0, output running time, and the results are stored in PageRank.$2.output and output.txt.
If the mode is 1, directly output the result to terminal.
